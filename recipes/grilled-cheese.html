    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong><em>grilled cheese (sometimes known as a toasted sandwich or cheese toastie)</em></strong> is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by <strong><em>heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise</em></strong> on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
    <p>The <strong><em>cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich</em></strong>, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression. U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling <strong><em>"American cheese filling sandwiches" during World War II.</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices cooked bacon</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices sourdough bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash together butter and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl until evenly blended.</li>
        <li>Make sandwiches by placing two slices of bacon and one slice of Cheddar cheese on half of the bread slices. Top with the remaining slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread some of the butter mixture on the top of each sandwich. Place sandwiches butter side down in the skillet. Spread the remaining butter mixture on the other sides. Cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>To serve, cut in half diagonally.</li>
    </ol>
