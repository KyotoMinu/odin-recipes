    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Red sauce pasta is a delicious pasta dish made with <strong><em>tomatoes, garlic, dried herbs and seasoning.</em></strong> Making Italian style red sauce is easy and quick for weeknight dinners just like my white sauce pasta.</p>
    <p>I have shared a basic red sauce recipe and made few variations like <strong><em>creamy red sauce pasta, cheesy red sauce pasta and baked pasta.</em></strong> Make sure you serve red sauce pasta with <strong><em>garlic bread, roast chicken and caesar salad</em></strong>for a filling meal.</p>
